# React Flow Function Chaining Project

This project is a dynamic function chaining tool built with React Flow, allowing users to create and manipulate a series of mathematical functions with a fixed execution order. The primary features include customizable function inputs, a visual representation of function connections, and a straightforward input/output system.

## Features

- **Function Cards**: Implement exactly five functions, each with a customizable input field for mathematical equations.
- **Input Validation**: Each input only accepts basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and exponents.
- **Fixed Execution Order**: Functions execute in a predetermined sequence (1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3).
- **Visual Representation**: The chaining of functions is represented with connected lines for better understanding.
- **Input/Output Handling**: Users can input an initial value, and the final output is displayed after applying all functions.
